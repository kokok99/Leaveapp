1. Need to install MySQL to your workspace - https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/
2. create user and password (user= root, password= kokok123)
3. for step 2, you can use your own password and username, just change the parameter later at the settings.py
4. make sure to change the port to 3300 (you can use the current port for mySQL or you can use other port and just change the parameter at settings.py)
5. After installation done, create schema name 'leaveapp' or any other name and just change the paramater later at settings.py
6. Finally you can do the migrations
